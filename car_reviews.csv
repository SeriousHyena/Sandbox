0,2019 Mercedes-Benz GLC,4,THE MERCEDES BENZ 2019 GLC IS VERY SMART. SOMETIMES IT IS A SMART ALEC!  SO MUCH TECHNOLOGY THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH ALL THE BELLS AND WHISTLES. BE PREPARED TO GET ALL THE LATEST IN TECHNOLOGY WHETHER YOU WANT IT OR NOT.,JILL B,"Apr 02, 2019500 milesOwned 7 months"
1,2019 Jeep Cherokee,5,"Excellent, reliable vehicle that handles the road like a pro. Perfect road trip and everyday car for my growing family.",Sarah,"Apr 02, 2019"
2,2019 Mercedes-Benz GLA,5,I LOVE THE WAY MY CAR ACCELARATES. I LOVE MY WIDE VIEW OF MY BACK UP ASSIST.  I LOVE MY CAR AS A WHOLE.,ROCHELLE,"Apr 02, 20195,600 milesOwned 11 months"
3,2019 Chevrolet Tahoe,5,"The Chevy Tahoe is very versatile.  Seats lay down easily when loading luggage, groceries, etc.  The automatic rear gate is a nice feature, that I use often. I love the touch screen for navigation, apple play, and other apps.  The safety features are amazing!  Features include automatic breaking, forward collision alert, and lane assist.  It took me a few weeks to get used to the new safety features, but I really love the extra safety my 2019 Tahoe provides.  Our vehicle insurance rate is also cheaper with the 2019 Tahoe due to the new safety features.  My grandsons love the rear-seat entertainment system, which is a bonus!",Anonymous,"Apr 02, 20199,000 milesOwned 6 months"
4,2019 Audi Q7,5,"Great vehicle, great performance.  Very impressed.  Owned a luxury sports vehicle for many years before the Audi Q7 and I would say the Q7 handles better than the Lexus(s) I have owned and outperforms them in practically every category, and its an SUV.",Anonymous,"Apr 01, 2019"
5,2019 Jaguar E-PACE,4,"Jaguar E-PaceS 250P. Very precise steering, excellent acceleration, awesome braking, great exterior styling, good road-holding and well controlled body roll. Very good ride quality. I have the adaptive suspension package. Good interior space. Love the huge sun-roof. I like the way the doors close to cover the sills...keeps my clothes from getting dirty when I get in/out. Only gripe would be limited choice of interior color options, and thought the carpets were below average quality. GPS system is OK but nothing special. Good visibility. Meridian sound system is very good. I like the higher driving position. Fuel economy is average/ reasonable but not frugal. Thought it handled much better than Audi's Q5; more lively and responsive. Audi steering felt uncommunicative, with tendency to understeer, I thought. I also just got rid of an Audi because at age 10 a lot of the plastic/ rubber components and seals were biodegrading and it was becoming too expensive to maintain ...I am hopeful that Jaguar uses better quality materials, and will cost less overall to maintain...time will tell, but the maintenance package they offer is a great start!",Anonymous,"Mar 31, 2019"
6,2019 Ford Flex,5,"i have a ford 
flex with 2998720 miles on it now do not like the condition of the new car came in was full of mistakes",C.,"Mar 31, 201915,000 milesOwned 7 months"
7,2019 BMW 7 Series,5,"Very dependable, road attractive, people friendly ,very easy to operate, excellent gas mileage for this type of automobile, and my Dealer is ""Johnny on the spot"" for my every need.
My only complain is the opening and getting to the armrest storage compartment from driver's side.Extremely difficult.",Anonymous,"Mar 30, 2019"
8,2019 MINI Countryman,4,"I love our Mini Countryman SE (Plug-in Hybrid). It is roomy, sporty, has good storage, handles the road well (including all wheel drive). I also really like the plug-in hybrid feature. The only negative is that the battery needs to be larger with a longer all electric range (~12 miles currently) and the gas tank needs to be slightly larger for when you are off electric. Other than that, it is a perfect car!",Brian,"Mar 29, 20194,500 milesOwned 6 months"
9,2019 Acura RLX,4,"I bought my Acura RLX AWD Sport Hybrid primarily because I wanted a hybrid AWD car rather than an SUV. My first new car bought in 1988 was an Acura Integra and I loved that car. I also wanted something sporty and fun that looked great and this car fits that perfectly. My only complaint seems to stem from software/technology issues. For example, the adaptive cruise control sometimes senses cars in front of me that aren't there. The Krell stereo system struggles with the interface to my phone. The home garage door link doesn't seem to work. Other than these issues, I've been very pleased with my car.",Connie,"Mar 29, 20196,500 milesOwned 4 months"
10,2019 Mercedes-Benz E-Class,3,"I would give this car 5 stars.  I test drove a 2019 Mercedes E450 convertible on a lark, ""knowing"" I was there to buy the sedan (my previous car was a 2012 E350), but the moment I accelerated in the convertible, I was in awe. The variety of driving options (comfort, sport, sport+) make this car so much more fun to drive! I bought the white with navy top, and it is the most beautiful car I have ever seen. Because of the relatively rare color combination, I often have people comment on how nice it looks. The back seat is large enough for two adults, which is outstanding for a convertible. The stereo sounds perfect, even with the top down at high speeds. The distronic plus system also makes this car *the* best drive on the road.  I will never buy a car without the distronic features again. I have been surprised that the car also has enough trunk room for two small suitcases when the top is down and one large, one medium when the top is up. Before purchasing, I did not consider that I can't talk on the phone while driving with the top down, but that's a trade I'm willing to make for this truly outstanding vehicle experience. The only thing I do not love about this car is that it does not have a CD player, nor does it have a number panel, so I can't just hit a number for a preset radio station.  Mostly, you can just talk to the car for radio stations, which works quite well for Sirius stations but not very well for typical AM/FM. But again, very minor things compared to the overall experience of this car! I don't even ""like"" cars, and the second I drove this model was the first time I have ever truly loved a vehicle.",Lori,"Mar 29, 20193,190 milesOwned 5 months"
11,2019 Ram Truck 1500,4,runs well runs good runs better than most cant fit in my garage runs good on the highway..parking is difficult,Richard,"Mar 27, 2019600 milesOwned 3 months"
12,2019 Ford Super Duty F-450 DRW,5,"like very much, does the job it was got for. would buy another if needed. best truck for the money and value out there.",Anonymous,"Mar 26, 201910,000 milesOwned 6 months"
13,2019 Kia Sorento,5,"My wife and I have owned 6 Kia Sorentos starting with 2 2004 models. Kia has improved each model year with new innovations small and large. We would truly recommend this vehicle to anyone that would like a quality vehicle and warranty. The vehicle has heated seats,automatic dimmer for the rear view mirror, easy to maneuver  seats. Great heat and air conditioning. The paint options are improving but need to go further.",Clem,"Mar 26, 20192,760 milesOwned 5 months"
14,2019 Mercedes-Benz G-Class,5,"The 2019 G wagon is completely redesigned! It is the best luxury SUV out there. The value for this class of SUVs, G-Wagon is the best! Better than the Bentley or Lambo SUV. The Rolls Royce SUV is too new and the styling is meh.",Max,"Mar 26, 20193,000 milesOwned 6 months"
15,2019 Nissan 370Z Coupe,4,"When comparing my 370Z to my 350Z, my 350Z was less dependent on a computer, and the older method of tuning with a timing belt was more precise. The 350Z accelerates faster. The 350Z automatic tiptronic goes into manual mode by pulling away from the driver, and the 370Z automatic tiptronic goes into manual mode by pulling toward the driver, so now I go into manual mode without wanting to just by the habitual way I hold the gear shift. The 350Z has better compartments inside the vehicle, like a sunglass compartment and more cup holders. There is much more trunk space in the 350Z because the spare tire stored in the trunk is not actual size. 350Z owners who want to update their Zs will be disappointed, though owners who haven't had a previous Z won't know what they're missing.",Anonymous,"Mar 26, 20193,100 milesOwned 7 months"
16,2019 BMW 7 Series,4,BMW 7 Series provides exceptional technology at value over other cars in its class and provides tremendous flexibility to customize.,Jimmy,"Mar 26, 201910,000 milesOwned 6 months"
17,2019 Mercedes-Benz GLC,4,The Mercedes-Benz GLC300 is a great vehicle it has good power and decent mileage (25mpg) and seats 4 or five or with rear seat down can haul a decent cargo.Drives smoothly and quietly. heated seats and radio and entertainment system are great features,John,"Mar 25, 20193,300 miles"
18,2019 Ram Truck 1500,3,"The gas mpg was supposed to be in the 22 - 24 range hwy.  We have gotten 19 at best.  With an average of 15.  Mostly hwy miles.  Our front leather seats had a layer peeling off.  With 5000 miles, Chrysler said it was natural wear and did not want to warranty.  The miles were all highway with very little in and out of seats. Used Uber when we got to our destinations. Chrysler finally replaced.  I do like the way the Ram handles and the roominess inside. The box leaks in a lot of water with a cover.  We have to make sure important stuff is sealed to keep it dry.  We had the same box covers on our F150 and we had no leakage.",Stan,"Mar 25, 20198,200 milesOwned 6 months"
19,2019 Hyundai Veloster,5,"I love hot hatchbacks, finding them the perfect combination of performance and practicality. Hyundai has really improved this 2nd generation Veloster. It's been kind of an old school fun ride, in that it had to be broken in (at around 2500 miles, the car just ""lit up"") and when cold, it snaps and pops on throttle blips. It's tuned stiff, which I like but some may not, and I drive the manual tranny version. I will admit I wish Hyundai would dump the 3-door layout, finding the missing door on the driver's side is often inconvenient. The power band of the engine is somewhat small, with not much punch being available below 3200 RPM, nor much above 6000 RPM, but what is there in that range is decent. The B&M shifter makes the throws short, but it is very ""notchy"" making it sometimes difficult to engage reverse. The brakes work great, but I think they could improve the pedal ""feel."" Overall, the car is great fun, reliable, and pretty good looking.",DiZ,"Mar 23, 20194,600 milesOwned 5 months"
